# /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.d/resolver.conf
# ======================================

# To set up a local `.foobar` TLD, you must also add a configuration file at
# `/etc/resolver/foobar` containing the following line:
#
# nameserver 127.0.0.1

# local-only domains (to be resolved by /etc/hosts or DHCP, or fail)
local=/test/

# always return a specific IP address for any host in a given domain
address=/test/127.0.0.1

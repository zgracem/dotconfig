This folder contains platform-specific settings for Sublime Text 3.

Because such files are ignored when in Packages/User, you must create a symlink for this folder as a sibling to Packages/User:

* OSX: `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/ZGM`
* Windows: `C:\Program Files\Sublime Text 3\Data\Packages\ZGM`

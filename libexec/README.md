# ~/.config/libexec

This directory contains various scripts I've written to be indirectly executed
by other software, e.g. Visual Studio Code's [tasks] (see [`tasks.json`]).

[tasks]: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks
[`tasks.json`]: https://github.com/zgracem/dotconfig/blob/main/.vscode/tasks.json

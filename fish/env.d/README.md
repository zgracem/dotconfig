# ~/.config/fish/env.d

`*.fish` files in this directory are sourced during startup, after the contents
of `~/.config/env.d`.

Simple instructions whose syntax is POSIX-compatible belong as a `.env` file in
`~/.config/env.d`. This directory is for variables that are set according to
more complex/less portable logic.

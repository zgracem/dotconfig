# `zgm-completions`

This directory contains completions for my own custom fish functions, which are
themselves mostly sourced from [`../../../functions`][fn] and [`../../../conf.d`][cf].

Files that supplement or replace fish's default completions (those that ship in
`$__fish_data_dir/completions` et al.) are located in [`../../../completions`][cp].

[fn]: ../../../functions
[cf]: ../../../conf.d
[cp]: ../../../completions

Relevant fish docs:

* [`complete` command reference](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/cmds/complete.html)

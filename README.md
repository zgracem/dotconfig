# ~/.config 🔩

Some people prune bonsai trees. I refactor my dotfiles. 🌱

## How I use this repo 👩‍💻

### Notes on compatibility & portability 💼

* These dotfiles are written to be portable between macOS (~10.5+), Cygwin,
  MSYS2, Windows 10's Subsystem for Linux, and both BSD and GNU flavours of
  \*nix.
* I try to conform to the [XDG Basedir Spec]: configuration for `foo` lives in
  `~/.config/foo/`, etc.
* Everything in `environment.d/` and `sh/` is compatible with any POSIX shell,
  as enforced by [`bin/check_dotfiles.sh`]. 👮
* My bash config files can be run (with gracefully degrading functionality) on
  any version from 3.2 to the latest 5.x release.
* Sadly, most of my fish configuration files can only run on version 3.0+.

### General usage 💁

* My main machine at home is a 2015 iMac that dual boots macOS Catalina and
  Windows 10; I also have a 2011 MacBook Air running High Sierra. My day-job
  computer is a very fast Dell with Windows 10, Cygwin, and no admin login 🤦‍♀.
  I also frequently SSH into web servers running various flavours of Linux 🐧.
* Dropbox keeps things synced between my Windows and Mac machines, and a custom
  `rsync` script pushes changes to my Linux boxes. 🔄
* On Windows, I use nightly builds of the venerable [PuTTY]; on Mac, I prefer
  [iTerm2] over the built-in Terminal.app; on iOS, there is only [Prompt]. ⌨️
* My first love will always be bash, but since February 2019 I've been using—and
  loving—[fish] as my primary shell. 🐟
* As of April 2019, I'm transitioning from a long-term relationship with Sublime
  Text to something more... _passionate_... with [Visual Studio Code][]. 💋
* Files that can be safely published to this GitHub repo live in `~/.config/`.
  Everything else lives in `~/.private/`, which is encrypted by [Keybase]. 🔐

### Setting up a new homedir 🏡

Minimum requirements:

    * `sh/`

Then restart the shell.

## How you can use this repo 🙋

In ascending order of difficulty:

* 👀 Browse it! It's on GitHub for a reason. Important directories have `README`
  files explaining their contents, usage, setup, etc.
* ⚖️ Clone it. You're [more than welcome][licence] to integrate anything cool
  you find into your own dotfiles.
* 🍴 Fork it? I guess? Everything's _extremely_ personalized; I do not expect
  and cannot guarantee that these will work "out of the box" for anyone but me.

The only condition—and it's a personal request, not a legal requirement—is that
if you find anything here interesting or useful, [drop me a note 📫][email] and
say so.

# ~/.config 🔩

Some people prune bonsai trees. 🌱 I refactor my dotfiles.

## How I use this repo 👩‍💻

### Notes on compatibility & portability 💼

* These dotfiles are written to be portable between macOS (~10.5+), Cygwin,
  MSYS2, Windows 10's Subsystem for Linux, and both BSD and GNU flavours of
  \*nix.
* I try to conform to the [XDG Basedir Spec]: configuration for `foo` lives in
  `~/.config/foo/`, etc.
* Everything in `environment.d/` and `sh/` is compatible with any POSIX shell,
  as enforced by [`bin/check_dotfiles.sh`]. 👮
* My bash config files can be run (with gracefully degrading functionality) on
  anything from bash-3.2 to the latest 5.x release. #️⃣
* Sadly, most of my fish configuration files can only run on 3.0.0 or newer. 🐟

### General usage 💁

* My primary machine at home is a 2015 iMac that dual boots macOS Mojave and
  Windows 10; I also have a 2011 MacBook Air running High Sierra. My day-job
  computer is a very fast Dell with Windows 7, Cygwin, and no admin login. 🤦‍♀
  And I frequently SSH into web servers running various flavours of Linux. 🐧
* Dropbox keeps things synced between my Windows and Mac machines, and a
  custom `rsync` script pushes changes to my Linux boxes. 🔄
* On Windows, I use nightly builds of the venerable [PuTTY]; on Mac, I prefer
  [iTerm2] over the built-in Terminal.app; on iOS, there is only [Prompt].
* As of April 2019, I'm transitioning from a long-term relationship with Sublime
  Text to something more... _passionate_... with [Visual Studio Code]. 💋
* Files that can be safely published to this GitHub repo live in `~/.config/`.
  Everything else lives in `~/.private/`, which is encrypted by [Keybase]. 🔐

### Shell startup 🌅

* `~/.config/environment.sh` loads environment variables for all POSIX shells
  from `environment.d/*.sh`
    * `fish/conf.d/___env.fish` does the same for `fish`
    * `misc/launchd.conf` makes them available to macOS GUI apps
* `~/.profile` is a symlink to `sh/profile.sh`, which sources
  `sh/profile.d/*.sh`
* `~/.bashrc` is a symlink to `bash/bashrc.bash`, which sources `bash/_*.bash`,
  `bash/*.d/*.bash`, and (if present) `~/.local/config/bashrc.d/*.bash`
    * `~/.local/config` is a symlink to `~/.config/local/$HOSTNAME/config`, if
      it exists
    * `bash/init.bash` and (if present) `~/.local/config/init.bash` are sourced
      immediately before the first prompt
    * `bash/logout.bash` and (if present) `~/.local/config/logout.bash` are
      sourced when `bash` exits

### Setting up a new homedir 🏡

Minimum requirements:

- `.config/` ← this repo
    - `bash/`
    - `dircolors/`
    - `environment.d/`
    - `readline/`
    - `sh/`
    - `vim/`
    - `environment.sh`
- `.private/` ← from encrypted repo
    - `bashrc.d/`
    - `environment.d/`
    - `ssh/`

Then:

```sh
cd ~ && ln -s .private/ssh ~/.ssh
cd ~/.config && make shell-files symlinks
```

Then restart the shell.

## How you can use this repo 🙋

In ascending order of difficulty:

* Browse it! 👀 It's on GitHub for a reason. Important directories have `README`
  files explaining their contents, usage, setup, etc.
* Clone it. ⚖️ You're [more than welcome][licence] to integrate anything cool
  you find into your own dotfiles.
* Fork it? 🍴 I guess? Everything's _extremely_ personalized; I do not expect and
  cannot guarantee that these will work "out of the box" for anyone but me.

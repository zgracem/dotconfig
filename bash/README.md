# ~/.config/bash

[Formerly] the jewel of my dotfiles. ðŸ’Ž

As of April 2022, the good stuff has been ported to [fish].

[Formerly]: https://github.com/zgracem/dotconfig/tree/cee87f6/bash
[fish]: https://github.com/zgracem/dotconfig/tree/master/fish

***

`./bashrc.bash` should be symlinked from `~/.bashrc`, and sources the following:

- `./_*.bash`
- `./*.d/*.bash`

# If you put Perl regular expressions, one per line, in a .stow-local-ignore file
# within any top level package directory, in which case any file or directory
# within that package matching any of these regular expressions will be ignored.
# In the absence of this package-specific ignore list, Stow will instead use the
# contents of ~/.stow-global-ignore, if it exists.
